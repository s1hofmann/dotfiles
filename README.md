My config files for i3 and Vim

Vim as an IDE
=============

After spending some time on configuring my Vim setup, it now pretty much offers all the neat features of common IDEs. 

Used plugins and their description are as follows:

| Plugin | What for? |
| ------ | --------- |
| vim-a | Quickly alternates files. By entering :A one can switch from implementation to header file and vice versa. |
| vim-airline | 'A lean and mean status/tabline'. |
| vim-delimitmate | Autocompletion for different kinds of delimiters (quotes, brackets etc.). |
| vim-nerdcommenter | Easy commen/uncomment blocks of source code. |
| vim-omnicppcomplete | Omnifunc C/C++ completion. |
| vim-supertab | Extended <Tab> use in insert mode. |
| vim-surround | The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and more. |
| vim-syntastic | A syntax checking plugin for Vim supporting several languages. |
| vim-tagbar | Displays tags of current file in a sidebar. |
| vim-ultisnips | Support for snippets. |
| vim-vcscommand | A plugin to manipulate files in a Version Control System. |
| vimplate | A template plugin for Vim. |
| -------- | ------- |
| vim-latexsuite | Edit LaTeX files with style. |

Other settings in .vimrc should be well commented.
